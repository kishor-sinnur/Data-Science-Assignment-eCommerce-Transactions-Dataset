# eCommerce Data Science Assignment

## Overview
This project involves an eCommerce Transactions dataset consisting of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build predictive models, and derive actionable insights.

## Task Summaries

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **File**: `kishor_sinnur_EDA`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook performs EDA on the provided dataset, analyzing customer distribution, product categories, and transaction trends. It generates business insights based on the analysis.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **File**: `Kishor_sinuur_Lookalike.ipynb`
- **Description**: This script builds a Lookalike Model that recommends similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. It calculates similarity scores and generates recommendations for the first 20 customers, saving the results in `Lookalike.csv`.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **File**: `kishor_sinnur_Clustering`
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques. It analyzes customer profiles and transaction data, determines the optimal number of clusters, and visualizes the results.

## Business Insights from EDA
1. Customer Distribution by Region
•	South America has the largest number of customers, followed by Asia and other regions with fewer customers.
•	Insight: South America is a key market. Focus marketing campaigns there to leverage the existing customer base. Invest in outreach efforts to expand into underrepresented regions.
2. Product Category Distribution
•	Product Categories: The most popular product categories are Electronics and Fashion, suggesting a focus area for marketing strategies.
•	 Premium Products Drive Revenue: High-value items like "TechPro Headphones" contribute significantly to revenue despite lower sales volumes. Focused promotion can enhance profitability.
•	 Popular Categories Boost Sales: High-demand products like "SoundWave Jeans" indicate clothing and books are customer favorites. Expanding these categories or offering deals can increase sales.
3. Consistent Transaction Volume
•	 Monthly transaction trends show a steady increase in sales, with peak months during holiday seasons, indicating seasonal buying behavior. 
•	Insight: Introduce special promotions or discounts during peak months to capitalize on increased customer spending. Conversely, off-peak months could benefit from targeted campaigns to stabilize sales
4. Frequent Buyers and Retention Opportunities
•	A significant number of customers signed up in the last year, highlighting potential for targeted retention strategies to enhance loyalty.
•	Insight: Create loyalty programs to incentivize frequent buyers and retain high-value customers. For instance, offer discounts or exclusive deals to repeat customers in high-revenue regions like South America.
5. Inventory Management
•	Insight: By analyzing the quantity sold and revenue generated, businesses can optimize inventory levels. Products with high sales should be replenished quickly, while slow-moving items can be discounted or removed.
•	 Implement automated inventory management systems that track sales trends in real-time and alert when products need to be restocked.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into customer behavior and product performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for eCommerce strategies.
